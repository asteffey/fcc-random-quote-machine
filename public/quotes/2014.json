{"quote":"What is your self-worth? Take a second to ponder. Is it the 100's in my pockets or the virtues and morals? It makes you wonder. Is diamonds what make your heart sound off or the thought of wanting someone to be true? Cause in truth, there's diamonds that abide in you, what a beautiful truth. True to be, let the value of love compare with the love of loyalty. I've learned this passion I once had for the love of money doesn't compare to the love of me. It's like one of them Pretty Ricky songs \"Love like honey\", yeah that's all me, self-worth value over infinity.I can go on with my ABC rhymes and keep stimulating your mind, make you see things with your eyes closed as if I'm leading the blind. This conscience cannot be bought with money or gold but my character and values last way past old. Put me deep in the dirt, the soils where I lay, sprout flowers of life, my soul lives on everyday.I have a question to ask, you might be as curious to hear: When's the last time you saw a Wells Fargo truck following a hearse? Don't let them try to trick you, once you're gone, your money can't be reimbursed. So the question is what lasts forever? If diamonds, money, even our flesh which is considered of such high importance soon perishes, what lasts forever? Give ear if you hear my words.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
