{"quote":"On the road to success, there is always room to share appreciation and gratitude for other peopleâ€™s successes. Feeling gratitude for other people raises our own vibration, while adding cement to the bricks we lay. Finding the best qualities in others allows us to build those qualities within ourselves. And when we focus on our personal growth with open hearts and minds, the speed with which we construct dramatically increases, because all the while, we are attracting more like energy and like-minded people into our lives to assist us.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
