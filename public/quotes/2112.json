{"quote":"Man is an animal, but even in his animalfunctions, he is not confined to the implicit, as the animal is; hebecomes conscious of them, recognizes them, and lifts them, as,for instance, the process of digestion, into self-conscious science.In this way man breaks the barrier of his implicit and immediatecharacter, so that precisely because he knows that he is an animal,he ceases to be an animal and attains knowledge of himself asspirit.","author":"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"}
