{"quote":"Life by its very nature is a challenge. It’s just like going to school. You learn and then you’re tested. If you don’t understand what you’ve learnt, you must retake the test, maybe over and over again until you begin to understand. It’s called life’s lessons in a school of rainy days and bright sunshine. The more you learn and become aware, the easier it is for you to forecast what lies ahead. It’s called intuition.","author":"Jacqueline Edgington"}
