{"quote":"I found one observation that is people are just stuck in technology and they just want to sit next to the computer and work hard on the internet or whatever it may be and so the mind started to dominate them. Just think if all humans just want to sit next to the computer then what will happen, comfort zone demands more comfort zone. The more we lessen physical activity, more will be the frustrations and agitations, it's time to act physically more and more, our physical dimension is more powerful than psychological dimension, just work upon it by doing yoga or other intense activities, if we do these #intense activities \"consciously\" then the mind will work the way we want it. The act could be anything like having a cup of tea, having a drink of water, playing chess, walking, talking, listening, all these activities should come to the place in tune with #consciousness.","author":"Abhinav Rajput"}
