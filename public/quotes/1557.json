{"quote":"There are an accountability and maturity to the process of self-love. It’s arriving at a place where you’re able to recognize the need and benefit of loving yourself first. You understand the value of bringing things to light instead of hiding from yourself. You realize the process of being in relationship requires you to be truthful, open, and honest with yourself because you are now extending the same access to the person you are in relationship with to be truthful, open and honest. And if you can’t be honest and accept who you are then the person you are in relationship with won’t be able to either.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
