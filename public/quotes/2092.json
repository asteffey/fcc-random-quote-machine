{"quote":"A writer is meant to make the readers feel and see things that they may not feel or see. A writer is meant to change the thought process of the society! To make the majority of people realise their true potential. A writer is meant to change the perceptions of society. To make the readers look at a mountain and see the potential of human consciousness. The consciousness that one day a human being has the potential to climb up that mountain. To make the readers look at the ocean and see the potential of human cconsciousness. The consciousness that one day a human being can dive into the farthest depths of that ocean!","author":"Avijeet Das"}
