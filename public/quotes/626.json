{"quote":"Why are the desert blooms that spring to life after a monsoon so magnificent? The answer is â€“ their impermanence. The lush growth and blooming flowers do not last very long here in the desert, and this new growth only happens once a year. If this growth was never-ending, we would soon take it for granted. Likewise, our human lives. What makes them so special and unique? Our fleeting impermanence.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
