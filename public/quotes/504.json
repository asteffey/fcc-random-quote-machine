{"quote":"Achievement of divine consciousness means innumerable people will give him this divine consciousness. Innumerable people will come and say, ‘We are you.’ So, when these people are announcing this before me, then only I am getting divine consciousness. At the same time they are also achieving it.","author":"Sri Jibankrishna or Diamond"}
