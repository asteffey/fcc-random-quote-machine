{"quote":"Make no mistake about it. We are born blind, deaf, and mute. It is neither these eyes that give us sight, nor these ears that give us sound. It is not even these lips that give us voice. It is only love. Love makes us seek beauty and truth. Love yearns to connect. To experience. To understand. So close your eyes at once. Donâ€™t utter a word. Perk up your ears and listen to that silent sound inside you where all this is found.","author":"Kamand Kojouri"}
