{"quote":"One cannot be awake with an ignited consciousness without empathy for all life. You can claim spirituality, faith in a God, or haughty deeds, but to shuffle through life with no thought to the suffering of all life forms, shows the true evil nature of an individual and its disconnect from life. They are separated from creation and this powerful, eternal Universe.","author":"Dara Reidyr"}
