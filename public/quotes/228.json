{"quote":"In life, every experience of a peak always follows the experience of a valley and we go back and forth between them. [â€¦] Until you understand that both the peaks and the valleys are inevitable and will eventually pass, and you disidentify from both sides, you will miss seeing your unmoving center, which is untouched by your thoughts, feelings or experiences.","author":"Eliza Mada Dalian"}
