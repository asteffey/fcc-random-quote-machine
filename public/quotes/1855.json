{"quote":"Two monks were arguing about the temple flag waving in the wind. One said, \"The flag moves.\" The other said, \"The wind moves.\" They argued back and forth but could not agree. The Sixth Ancestor said, \"Gentlemen! It is not the wind that moves; it is not the flag that moves; it is your mind that moves.","author":"The Mumonkan Case 29 translation by Robert Aitken"}
