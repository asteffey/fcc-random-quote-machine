{"quote":"İf you associate the Self with the control over feeling, perception, consciousness (subjective awareness), or something else, in short, what is going on inside your brain, it would mean that the Self doesn’t exist, because it cannot control none of the aforementioned mental states. All of them are automatically controlled by the brain but not by the Self. None of them is permanent, all are mutable, constantly changing the appearences in accordance with bio-chemical changes in the brain. For instance, in most cases, if not all, it is impossible to pre-arrange what to feel or how to perceive, all of them are automatically realized by the brain. A person cannot deliberately identify which part of information should be on a conscious level, which part should be on unconscious level of the mind, considering that more than 90% of all information is hidden from the consciousness and for that reason a person is simply not aware of what is really happening inside the brain and mind. That is why it is said that the vast majority of humans are merely a bio-social robot without any self that can assume some real control of anything in life. With regard to them, the Self is an illusion, a kind of metaphoric figure.","author":"Elmar Hussein"}
