{"quote":"Last weekend, grandad and I sat on the porch in silence at sunset.We admired the grapes hanging on the vines. Time passed and it did not matter. That moment was precious, that moment was to be cherished. That moment was a healer. That moment was rich, comfortable and words were unneeded. We had each other sitting side by side and the luxury of a moment lived in its full presence. That is all that mattered.The best things in life are really free.","author":"Ana Ortega"}
