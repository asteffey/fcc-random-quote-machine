{"quote":"Curiously, our first-person point of view of our own minds is not so different from our second-person point of view of other's minds: we don't see, or hear, or feel, the complicated neural machinery churning away in our brains but have to settle for an interpreted, digested version, a user-illusion that is so familiar to us that we take it not just for reality but also for the most indubitable and intimately known reality of all.","author":"Daniel Dennett"}
