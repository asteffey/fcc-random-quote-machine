{"quote":"The basic teaching of all religions is silence.A silence spread in our inner being, the mind will begin to dissolve. That silence unites you with truth. When a person is ready to dissolve into silence, his ego will disappear, and he will not be separated from existence. A holy person means one who has become silent within. A spiritual teacher is a death, because the ego of the student will dissolve completely. Within the student arises a pure emptiness, and samadhi is born.","author":"Swami Dhyan Giten"}
