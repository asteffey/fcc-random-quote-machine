{"quote":"When we free up the resistance within us we are able to approach any situation from a place of clarity. When you enter into any situation with a particular stance it is primarily filtered through your perspective. Even if you try and run through the scenario of how your partner may feel and what they may be thinking something will be missed because you are only filtering it through your level of understanding.","author":"Victoria L.
