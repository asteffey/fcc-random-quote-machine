{"quote":"Without free will, there would be no compassion or charity in the world. Without consciousness and free will, we might be able to care for ourselves, but how would we ever expand our scope of compassion to take care of other people? Human free will enables us to rise above the selfishness that rules the unconscious mind and act in a conscientious manner to improve our lives and other people’s actuality. Stated differently, humankind’s ability to negate selfishness and employ consciousness and free will to reject biological impulses blunts an entirely deterministic outcome of human fate and renders meaning to our otherwise meaningless existence.","author":"Kilroy J.
