{"quote":"God has no name. All organized religions have given names to God to be able to have a personal relationship to God, but God is not a person.God is the underlying force, the energy and the consciousness of existence.If you cannot feel God, the divine, within, you cannot feel him without.The first step is to feel God within.Then prayer to a personal god becomes meaningless, and meditation becomes meaningful.The second step is to realize God without, to realize that God is not the creator, he is creation. He is not separate from creation. He is the force and consciousness of creation. The world is God's dance; the world is God's play.","author":"Swami Dhyan Giten"}
