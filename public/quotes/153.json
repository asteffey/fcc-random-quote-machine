{"quote":"Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness. We form friendships so that we can feel love and avoid lonelinessâ€¦. We read for the pleasure of thinking another person's thoughts. Every waking moment, and even in our dreams, we struggle to direct the flow of sensation, emotion, and cognition towards states of consciousness that we value.","author":"Sam Harris"}
