{"quote":"Enslave me or deliberately liberate me as I'm meant to be. Dependent on God is a mindset in ancient, present and future prophecy. Hallucinations of the light coming to an illumination of Truth for death has no place in the life of an immortal. The third eye is a wide open portal. I brush off any of lifes struggles, any of lifes limits. I have no shame, Jesus is my Savior and with redemptive pride, I admit it.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
