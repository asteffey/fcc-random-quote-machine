{"quote":"What if we just smooched each investment with a little energy tag - an intention for our circulation? Just an intention that acknowledges that money will do what you tell it to do and what you intend for it to do. Try it. Every time you circulate money whether a big or small amount, just add a little energetic tag on it with a silent intention generate more consciousness or perhaps something even more specific, like when you buy a ticket for a business event, my intention for this investment is that it generates crazy amounts of new epic knowledge that help me take my business to new levels of enjoyment and abundance.Money is always listening. And money is always working. Money works 24/7 and doesn't ever sleep. It's always being recirculated reinvested, and regenerated. And if conscious, heart-centered, beautiful humans like you don't give it some love then others will, and perhaps you won't like it. Just like many don't like what money is doing now. It's not money's fault. Money wants a heart like yours giving more specific instruction for it to generate more consciously, which is why I am so big on bridging the gap between consciousness and money. Because money wants to be a valuable member in the pursuit of a more conscious, aware, harmonious world, and people in the light need to step up and play.","author":"Peta Kelly"}
