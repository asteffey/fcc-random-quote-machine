{"quote":"Going beyond thoughts is merely to reduce the multiplicity of your thought.Thoughts lead to words, words to language, language to action. Action to realization, and back again to thoughts.For the mind is made up of words, language and logic, until it dissolves into consciousness.","author":"Gian Kumar"}
