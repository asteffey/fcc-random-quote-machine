{"quote":"It so happens that the primary though - as an act of thought - already has a form and is more easily transmitte to itself, or rather, to the very person who is thinking it; and that is why - because it has a form - it has a limited reach. Whereas the thought called \"freedom\" is free as an act of thought. It's so free that even to its thinker it seems to have no author.","author":"Clarice Lispector"}
