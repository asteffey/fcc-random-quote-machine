{"quote":"In-between every heartbeat is the force that beats it. This \"Force\" signifies the presence of God within--the giver of life. This \"force\" is indefinable, unidentifiable--with no shape, color or status. When we focus on this force with all our might, by focusing to recognize what exists in-between each heartbeat, we start to recognize the glimpse of our true nature.","author":"Dr. Jacinta Mpalyenkana"}
