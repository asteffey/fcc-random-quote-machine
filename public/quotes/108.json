{"quote":"Chaos brings movement to whatever is stagnant in your life. Stagnation leads to apathy, numbness, illness, suffering, etc. Be grateful for the situations in your life that may seem chaotic in the present moment, and realize that, in the greater scheme of things, chaos is Spirit giving you an opportunityâ€¦ or possibly pushing you to move, grow, and be in the flow.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
