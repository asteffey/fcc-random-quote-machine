{"quote":"Suddenly I realized that a cell's life is controlled by the physical and energetic environment and not by its genes. Genes are simply molecular blueprints used in the construction of cells, tissues, and organs. The environment serves as a \"contractor\" who reads and engages those genetic blueprints and is ultimately responsible for the character of a cell's life. It is a single cell's \"awareness\" of the environment, not its genes, that sets into motion the mechanisms of life.","author":"Bruce H. Lipton"}
