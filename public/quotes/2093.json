{"quote":"Buddhist philosophy points out that the true nature of all forms is essentially formless. Forms do not have an existence of their own, but rather they arise together, and are mutually dependent on one another. Everything in the world of form is constantly changing, constantly dying, and constantly being rebornâ€”which is why Buddhists say that there is no-self; no form that has an existence in and of itself.","author":"Joseph P.
