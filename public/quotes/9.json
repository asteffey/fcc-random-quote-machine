{"quote":"You must understand your individual temperament and have an awareness of your inner voice. What often happens when you enter into a relationship and you have no previous knowledge of your perception of love and your ability to be love, you begin to look for it within another one. Which is a dangerous thing because the tide of relationship will always be changing based on your perception of the idea of the love you are experiencing.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
