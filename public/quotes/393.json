{"quote":"A light bulb is capable of shining light on the room around it but not on the power which illuminates it. In the same way, we’re capable of comprehending the world around us but not the consciousness which animates us. It’s beyond the normal functioning of the mind, beyond words, beyond even thought itself.","author":"Dada Gunamuktananda"}
