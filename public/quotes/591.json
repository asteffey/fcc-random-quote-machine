{"quote":"Become a humble, non-resistant & agreeing with thy adversary, for it is the only way to be. This is true because we must \"be\" before we can \"do\" and we can \"do\" only to the extension in which we \"are\", and what we are depends on what we \"think\".When we think we are, we can do, and when we do, do we become free from tyranny.","author":"Jose R.
