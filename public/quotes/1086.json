{"quote":"Whenever a judgment is present wholeness cannot exist. We must be willing to let go of judgments towards ourselves in order to come into alignment with our wholeness. When we align with our wholeness we rise from the inside out, and then we are able to share the highest manifestation of ourselves with the world.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
