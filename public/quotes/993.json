{"quote":"When you have your best interest at heart, because your first relationship is with yourself and you will not have someone else’s best interest at heart before having your own, you wouldn’t purposely choose to open yourself up to a detrimental experience. You would apply your knowingness and understand the importance of choosing to enter into situations that preserve your inner work.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
