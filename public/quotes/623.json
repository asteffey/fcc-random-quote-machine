{"quote":"It appears to me that the only choice you cannot affect is your transition to the spiritual world. It is going to happen irrespective of whether you do or do not believe in it, you don’t like it, or you don’t even want it. If you believe that your physical death means the end of everything, you might be surprised that it does not, by Jozef.","author":"Jozef Simkovic"}
