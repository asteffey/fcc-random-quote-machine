{"quote":"As we stand before this sacred doorway [the doorway to meaning], we realize its response to us is conditional, albeit only in the sense that itâ€™s reflective. If we stand before it arrogant and haughty, indeed the door will remained locked. If we stand before it in doubt, it will disappear. If we knock upon it distracted, our minds somewhere else, we fail to see it open. Anyone in the world can go through it, and there could never be a key. Yet it opens only when we approach it in a certain, truthful way. Otherwise, we may not notice its openness and its infinite offering again and again.","author":"Tehya Sky"}
