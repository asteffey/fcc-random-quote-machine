{"quote":"Find and foster your Passions in life! People who are passionate about what they do are in alignment with Spirit and become magnetic to those around them. This also applies to those already in long-term relationships. How do you keep the love and intimacy alive? Keep your personal Passions alive and the rest will fall into place. We canâ€™t share passions with others unless we first have it within ourselves.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
