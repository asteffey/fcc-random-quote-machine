{"quote":"Past and Future exist in the mind. They exist in the outside world. The mind is shaped by the physical world. Past and future however do NOT exist within the body. Because the present moment is all that you have and will ever be able to experience from within. Presence is how you fully exist. Internal (No-mind, no-time, awareness) is how you fully exist.","author":"Matthew Donnelly"}
