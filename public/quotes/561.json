{"quote":"When you know the beginning you will know the end and when we understand that our consciousness is eternal, we see that we are in fact energy. A soul, a consciousness that is always evolving, learning and growing. With each incarnation comes new lessons, and new experiences. We grow the most through incarnation, the challenges, the long separation from source, through the exploration of the vastness of hosting planets. We come from energy and to energy we will return","author":"L.J. Vanier"}
