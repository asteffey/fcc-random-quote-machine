{"quote":"A mission of over abundant crops, it's a vision of mansions and Ferrari drop tops. Lay me in a tomb wearing a crown with a serpent on its midpoint; it's a symbol of perfect consciousness, a knowledge of my power as limitless. Take a look to the Bible and turn back to Yahweh standard of perfectionists.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
