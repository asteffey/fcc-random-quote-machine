{"quote":"The human mind registers a false perception of physical reality from the occurrences that make an impression upon the senses. Human consciousness is an orderly organization of human perceptions of the structure and ratio of physical reality, of which we attempt to share by communicating our perceptions and justifiable true beliefs with other people. The infinite fallibility of the human mind, along with the inability of any human being to know with certainty if anyone else shares an identical perception of reality, makes some personal truths forever elusive and uncommunicable.","author":"Kilroy J.
