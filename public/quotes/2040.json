{"quote":"I'm moving and not moving at all. I'm like the moon underneath the waves that ever go on rolling and rocking. It is not, \"I am doing this,\" but rather, an inner realization that \"this is happening through me,\" or \"it is doing this for me.\" The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action.","author":"Bruce Lee"}
