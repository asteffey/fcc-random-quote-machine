{"quote":"Consciousness is a result of environment. Our cognitions -- our idea of reality—are shaped by what we can perceive, by the limitations of our senses. We think we’re seeing the world as it really is, but... it’s all just shadows on the cave’s wall.... Every moment is equally real and happening now, but the nature ofour consciousness only gives us access to one slice at a time.... Our flawed perception shuts off access to all the others.","author":"Blake Crouch"}
