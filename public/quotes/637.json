{"quote":"The term spirit might have evolved in a mystical fashion, but in todayâ€™s civilized and thinking society, it refers to simply your inner self. Spirit is the self, and the self is the soul. Hence, a spiritual person is a person who is more interested in realizing his or her inner self, than giving in to any conformity of the society.","author":"Abhijit Naskar"}
