{"quote":"Imagine you come from a planet where love reigns supreme, as the girl Mila in the film La Belle Verte. You visit Planet Earth and for the first time you will taste the duality of existence. Itâ€™s all about limitations or abundance, good or bad, light and dark. Where is the love? You see borders between countries, cultures, and hope and belief systems. Almost everyone makes distinction between body and mind, you and me, nature and objects. You see a fragmented worldview that permeates how life is organized","author":"Ivo Valkenburg"}
