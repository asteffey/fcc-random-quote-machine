{"quote":"When we say we understand something, but we do not experience it, we do not understand it. Understanding and experiencing are the same thing. For example, we may say: I understand the importance of forgiveness BUT I can't do it. Firstly, replace \"I can't do it\" with:I am choosing to remain in the state of being of ignorance (misinformation), because I believe it to be the best option I can choose from.Secondly, replace \"I understand the importance of forgiveness\" with:\"I do not understand the importance of forgiveness\". Being honest with oneself is the first step to self-understanding.","author":"Raphael Zernoff"}
