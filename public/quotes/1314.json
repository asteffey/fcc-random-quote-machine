{"quote":"A cricketer who hits a century in one match may score zero in the next, if he does not have the same outfit, shoes and bat that he used in the first match. In fact, many sportsmen keep some kind of talisman in their pocket that acts as a lucky charm for their game. Here the talisman or the outfit doesnâ€™t possess any magical power that helps the player to perform better. But it is their own subconscious reliance on the charm, that makes them give their best.","author":"Abhijit Naskar"}
