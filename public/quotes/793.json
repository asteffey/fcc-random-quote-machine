{"quote":"My philosophy: Don't get caught with a fixed philosophy, a setof safe beliefs, a particular way of life.Experiment! With live, with love.Run an exploration of the real and the true degrees of freedomof life, of love, of the human condition, inside self and in one'sstyle of life.Move! Into new spaces beyond one's present concepts of possible/probable/certain real spaces.Far vaster than I now know are the innermost/outermost realities.Far more interesting than I now feel are the deeps of the space, the beyond within, the infinite without.Love and loving are basic.Hostility is redundant.Fear is non-sense.\"Death\" is a myth.I am I.","author":"John C.
