{"quote":"REPENT:FOR THE KINGDOM OF GODIS AT HANDThe whole message of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ are: Repent: For the Kingdom of God is at hand.But this message has been terrible misunderstood by the priests and the Christians.It is almost the same kind of people that crucified Jesus, which founded Christianity.The symbol for Christianity has also become the cross on which Jesus was crucified, which is a bit morbid.When you do not repent, your eyes will be filled with this world: the world of possession, the world of greed, the world of anger and hate, the world of ego and the world of hatred.Your eyes has to be completely cleansed before you can see the Kingdom of God.Repentance will open the door to God, to the divine.What does it mean to repent? Repentance does not mean to ask to be forgiven for making a mistake. This will not change you, it will not transform you.What John the Baptist and Jesus Christ mean by repentance is something totally different. They mean to look to the very roots of your being, of your existence. It is not about asking to repent for a specific act, it is about changing the whole quality of your being.It is about returning to your original being. Jesus says that the Kingdom of God is within you. The Kingdom of God is to return to your deepest core of being, which transforms you.It is to stand naked before God.","author":"Swami Dhyan Giten"}
