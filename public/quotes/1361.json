{"quote":"I think there is a process where all our consciousness goes in circles if you like from one body to the other or it goes into another dimension where your next life begins and you keep moving up dimensions like a ladder through the universe or whatever. There so many different possibilities.- If we ask, where will the human conciousness goes when they dies?But Isnt that the greatest question in the world I would love to know as Peter Pan once said \"to die would be an awfully big adventure\", but realy i don't know because I'm not dead yet, you know it can be one with the universal consciousness. we are one consciousness manifested in different forms.","author":"Marouane LAASSAFAR"}
