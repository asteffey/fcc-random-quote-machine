{"quote":"Since they donâ€™t yet understand the purpose of the relationship and it lacks the intention to move forward in a particular direction they find themselves extending more and more to the other person hoping to find a deeper connection but really they are just filling a void. A void which would not be there if each individual had aknowingness of who they are and entered into the relationship with awareness and commitment to cultivate a union that went beyond meeting surface needs and replaying of karmic patterns.","author":"Victoria L.
