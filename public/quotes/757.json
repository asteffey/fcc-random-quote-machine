{"quote":"One overriding theme of the Principle of Manifestation is that your outer world reality is a direct reflection and projection of your inner consciousness. If the outer world is turbulent, it is because your inner consciousness is turbulent. If you calm your inner self, your outer world will mirror the calm. Master your inner consciousness and you will master manifestation.","author":"Russell Anthony Gibbs"}
