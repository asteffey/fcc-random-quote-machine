{"quote":"When we agree to enter into relationship it’s an agreement to throw away our self-serving desires for the purpose of working together. Throwing away self-serving desires is not throwing away your self-care and personal growth. It’s instead opening up and extending yourself to the other person to work with you to grow and vice versa while still maintaining your own growth.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
