{"quote":"Manifestation is directed by the multiple levels of consciousness, including the subconsciousness, unconsciousness and the collective consciousness. Everything has a degree of consciousness, including animals, plants and even inanimate objects. Everyone and everything is a part of the collective consciousness and plays a role in co-creating the physical universe.","author":"Russell Anthony Gibbs"}
