{"quote":"Conflict forces us to be fully present because it shatters our ego â€“ stripping away all hope of escape or sugar coating. It removes everything that is nonessential to our authentic being; it removes all superficial layers. Conflict is painful because it wakes us up out of our created illusions. And if we lean into it, conflict can be the catalyst to our enlightenment.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
