{"quote":"We need more explorers in consciousness and less followers of beliefs, isms, and credos.Religions and spiritual leaders influence millions by pushing their beliefs. They believe in the Bible, the Koran, and the Gita, but do not personally ‘know’ the essence within them. Too many believe in beliefs and are not who they profess to be, nor any closer to the truth than the totally unaware.","author":"Robert Cosmar"}
