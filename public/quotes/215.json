{"quote":"The truth of the matter is, anyone, can master sexuality, but can you master partnership, and if you understand sexuality, it is a partnership, even on the simplest level with yourself. This relationship is all about partnership. Sexuality is a relationship with yourself and then another, and if you don't want the partnership, it becomes very self-centered, and it becomes a very harmful thing, and a very dangerous thing.","author":"Victoria L.
