{"quote":"When we’re outside of alignment we’re outside of love and our perceived experiences of love are not love at all but rather attachments of the ego. We must be willing to surrender the ego, to our higher self, our higher existence. When we refuse thissurrendering we make the choice to go through painful experiences that are heartbreaking and frustrating until we make the choice to surrender and come into alignment with our higher self, our wholeness. This experience of surrendering andalignment does not constrict us to a rigid existence but rather expands us into infinite possibilities. We are now a reflection of source, which is infinite and free flowing.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
