{"quote":"Surrendering is having an openness, it is a blossoming and encompasses the ability, to be honest, vulnerable, and trust another. Surrendering is not the same as giving into everything your partner says or throwing away your stance without reason. Surrendering is ending the resistance within you and the relationship as whole by coming together mutually and (w)holistically for the purpose of a greater understanding.","author":"Victoria L.
