{"quote":"Cosmic sexuality is remembering that we are more than these bodies and by coming into alignment with this deeper truth, we tune into our greater cosmic existence. Tuning into our greater cosmic existence, we are now coming into greater alignment with source. As we achieve this level of alignment, we can transcend the physical base levels of sexuality and enter into the higher aspects of sexuality itself.","author":"Shalom Melchizedek"}
