{"quote":"Being conscious makes our existence so heavy, and it needs nothing less than a great understanding to make it light again. We manifest the most advanced form of unconscious development within a nature which we know so little about it, more or less living a state of ignorance. This is what makes consious heavy and what makes knowledge exciting. This is what makes a mind so curious.","author":"Nader Ibrahim"}
