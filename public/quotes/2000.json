{"quote":"[T]he understanding or the reason is the necessary being. â€¦ [I]f there were no reason, no consciousness, all would be nothing; existence would be equivalent to non-existence. Consciousness first founds the distinction between existence and non-existence. In consciousness is first revealed the value of existence, the value of nature.","author":"Ludwig Feuerbach"}
