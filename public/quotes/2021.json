{"quote":"When we think of something, we create a mental image of it, and our image is then always filtered through our mental perception. We may meet someone one day when they are in a bad mood, we then make a false assumption that this person does not like us. We have created an image of this person, and now every time we meet them, we associate this person with our negative mental image of them. We donâ€™t interact with them as they are in this moment; we interact with how we think they are.","author":"Joseph P. Kauffman"}
