{"quote":"Generally, truth is paradoxical where both sides combined come together to create the truth needed and itâ€™s very hard to see that truth if two people believe that their perspective is greater than the other. So it requires those two individuals to come together, in a very centered way, and in a very peaceful way, and peaceful not in the sense of non-quarreling but peaceful in the sense of allowance and trust to reach the center point together, of truth.","author":"Shalom Melchizedek"}
