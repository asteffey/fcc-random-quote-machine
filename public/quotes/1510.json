{"quote":"The pressures of life created a diamond, now what I leave behind is a legacy. This game is betrayal. Everyone brags about being real but it's a false sense of a two sided man, an incorporated brand,There's no future in this front. Operating a strategy mathematically created; persistently and perfectly knitted to keep the mass dependent on its assistancy.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
