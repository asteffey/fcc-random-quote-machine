{"quote":"Relationships are steppingstones for the evolution of our consciousness. Each interaction we have, be it one of joy or contrast, allows us to learn more about who we are and what we want in this lifetime. They bring us into greater alignmentâ€¦as long as we continue to move forward and do not get attached to hurt, anger, or being a victim.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
