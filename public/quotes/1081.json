{"quote":"We have allowed ourselves very little space for not-knowing. Very seldom do we have the wisdom not-to-know, to lay the mind open to deeper understanding. When confusion occurs in the mind, we identify with it and say we are confusedâ€¦Confusion arises because we fight against our not-knowing, which experiences each moment afresh without preconceptions or expectations.","author":"Stephen Levine"}
