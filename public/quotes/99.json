{"quote":"What's meant to be is set; High priesthood is the philosophers stone turning all your worthless metals into golden thrones. God & I do it alone; complete opposition of the human hive of these drones for they're prone to do as they're told. Threaten them with fictitious statues, watch em fall and they fold. It's winter blizzard year-round for this dictatorship is heartless and cold. Where is there to turn to when there's no where to go? Can't tell the difference between friendly and foe.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
