{"quote":"Fear and paranoia create many of our worldly struggles. We get something in our minds and our distorted perception sculpts the reality of what we see. Even though what we see isnâ€™t really there, we tend to act as if it is. We then begin to put people and things into boxes, labeling them, and limiting them due to our fears.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
