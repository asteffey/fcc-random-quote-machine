{"quote":"Consciousness is an evolutionary step in human life that must never cease transforming individual persons and the species as a whole. Perchance by using cognitive thought processes to eliminate aguish, reduce fear, and control personal desires, I will learn to follow a path of balance, avoid extremism, and someday attain a state of mental quietude. I aspire to live simply, strive for humility and peacefulness, and not allow prior failures or other peopleâ€™s perceptions to intimidate me from developing into my truest being. I need to exhibit curiosity, willingly experiment, create dangerously, and steadfastly seek authenticity and spiritual enlightenment. I cannot allow prior failures or disgraceful stumbles to deter me from metamorphosing into the final manifestation of my being. A hidden aspect of my nature patiently waits unveiling by the interactive duality of the conscious and unconscious mind as my physical body marches through time.","author":"Kilroy J. Oldster"}
