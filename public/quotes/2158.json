{"quote":"Some of us keep searching outwards but at some point instinctively you realize that when you’ve accumulated everything there’s nothing else left outside of you. It happens as an internal realization, that after you conquer everything that you were set out to conquer you need something deeper, you need something more and love is that more.","author":"Shalom Melchizedek"}
