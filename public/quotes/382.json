{"quote":"Somedays i can make sense of this place, this horrendous fucking world and the way it shapes humans into monsters and monsters into leaders. Building empires off of the poor and using a system designed to manifest the wars? But then i look to the eyes of my child, i write, i paint, i listen to music that holds beliefs far deeper than mine and i am reminded - for all that is devastating there is equal amounts of ehuphoria, you just have to look a little harder to find the light sometimes.","author":"Nikki rowe"}
