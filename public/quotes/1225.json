{"quote":"The Turing Test was invented in 1950 by British mathematician Alan Turing, one of the fathers of the computer age. Turing was also a gay man in a period when homosexuality was illegal in Britain. In 1952 he was convicted of committing homosexual acts and forced to undergo chemical castration. Two years later he committed suicide. The Turing Test is simply a replication of a mundane test every gay man had to undergo in the 1950s Britain: can you pass for a straight man? Turing knew from personal experience that it didn't matter who you really were - it mattered only what others thought of you. According to Turing, in the future computers would be just like gay men in the 1950s. It won't matter whether computers will actually be conscious or not. It will matter only what people think about it.","author":"Yuval Noah Harari"}
