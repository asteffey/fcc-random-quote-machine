{"quote":"It is your telepathic ability when a person crosses your mind at any point of the day. They came to mind for a reason. They may be attempting to reach out to you. We are all connected by a universal web of consciousness. Through a thread a message makes its way to the mind. One pluck of a string on the web and it sends a telegram through a single sensitive nerve that receives the message and transports it through the brain or heart depending upon the nature of the message and in which it resonates. We're all part of the same web.","author":"Jason Micheal Ratliff"}
