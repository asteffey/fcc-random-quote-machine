{"quote":"Consciousness is continually widening its expanse. One becomes more and more conscious, but not as an individual. Ultimately there is no self-consciousness, and no self. The only reality is consciousness itself, no separation. When a person meditates deeply they lose awareness of the body and become part of this expanse of consciousness. They become aware that what they thought was their own consciousness is part of Consciousness itself.","author":"Russel Williams"}
