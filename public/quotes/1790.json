{"quote":"Everyday that goes by you help me build my character and little by little, I gain more self-control and mastery over myself. The vast greatness of our oneness together completes me from soul to flesh, from Heaven to Earth, from head to toe. Your cosmic power brings me to consciousness of the cosmos. I put all my hope and my faith in you.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
