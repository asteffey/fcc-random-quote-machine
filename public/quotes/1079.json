{"quote":"The scientist would look at a sphere, measure the surface in great detail, categorize the skin qualities and components, then predict evolving surface tensions and potentials. The use of that sphere, however, along with its beauty and potential would not be of interest. Science would count the bricks of a house, but not care about living in it, thus missing the point â€“ but thinking that, by quantifying the physical, everything had been covered.","author":"Thomas Daniel Nehrer"}
