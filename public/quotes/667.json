{"quote":"It's a thought,\" I said with a grin.\"That's exactly what it is, Dan - a thought - no more real than the shadow of a shadow. Consciousness is not In the body; the body is In Consciousness. And you Are that Consciousness - no the phantom mind that troubles you so. You are the body, but you are everything else, too. That is what your visions revealed to you. Only the mind resists change. When you relax mindless into the body, you are happy and content and free, sensing no separation. Immortality is Already yours, but not in the same way you imagined or hope for. You have been immortal since before you were born and will be long after the body dissolves. The body is in Consciousness; never born; never dies; only changes. The mind - your ego, personal beliefs, history, and identity - is all that ends at death. And who needs it?\" Socrates leaned back into his chair.\"I'm not sure all of that sank in.\"\"Of course not.\" He laughed. \"Words mean little unless you realize the truth of it yourself. And when you do, you'll be free at last.","author":"Dan Millman"}
