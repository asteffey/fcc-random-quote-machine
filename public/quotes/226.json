{"quote":"When you lose the idea of lonely you close the doorway for dependency to seep through. When you are whole you have a connection to self, and a connection to self is a connection to source. A connection to source is a connection to all, and you realize choosing to be lonely is choosing to be ignorant to the divineâ€™s presence within your life.","author":"Victoria L. White"}
