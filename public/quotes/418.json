{"quote":"If you are alive and breathing you are very capable of experiencing a cosmic connectivity with explosive intimacy. Both partners must be on the same frequency spiritually and mentally and the rest will follow. We are spirits on a human journey and all roads to life will lead us back to each other and the universe as a whole.","author":"Shalom Melchizedek"}
