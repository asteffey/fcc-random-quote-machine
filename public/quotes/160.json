{"quote":"What do you mean by ‘Divine Consciousness’? It is achieving the knowledge of oneness, i.e., to know that outside we are many but inside all are one.‘Vedanta’ mentioned about ‘oneness’, but could not say what is oneness. When I am saying that I am a living being all your Vedanta’s, scriptures and traditional religions become extinct.","author":"Sri Jibankrishna or Diamond"}
