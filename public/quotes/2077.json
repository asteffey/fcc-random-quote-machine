{"quote":"Unlike the laws of reality that scientist describe in complex mathematical equations, the laws that govern human behavior are imprecise and in constant flux. We are complex organisms because we possess the capacity to experience, recall, and imagine. We are self-constructed. How we think becomes our reality. The highest act of human intelligence is not building bombs and inventing poisons that can destroy the world, but engaging in acts of contemplation that expands human consciousness.","author":"Kilroy J.
