{"quote":"To know life you to learn the art of death.A seeker of truth who wants to know life must go through the experience of death.Man consists of two layers: 1. The body, which belongs to the dimension of death and 2. The soul, the consciousness, which belongs to life itself. A person who accepts death will attain to the deathless. For the person who is conscious about death, death does not exist. Then death becomes a door to the deathless, to the eternal.","author":"Swami Dhyan Giten"}
