{"quote":"Regardless of type, however, the mechanism of a religion works like this: children, from the time they can communicate, are taught to see reality in a certain way. They are indoctrinated with a pre-defined belief structure and value set. Naive, open to such teaching, given only the religious viewpoint and perhaps punished or ostracized if they donâ€™t accept it, most ultimately absorb and mimic the religion outright.","author":"Thomas Daniel Nehrer"}
