{"quote":"My stomach rumbles in this governed jungle, hunger drives as I drop the clutch into the 9th. Triple double struggle and only God knows my own. Cold world I need a fur coat to keep me snuggle and warm. I favor myself in this trouble I try to maintain, shout out to the chain gang, changed my life from spare change into a hole elevated mind frame.","author":"Jose R. Coronado"}
