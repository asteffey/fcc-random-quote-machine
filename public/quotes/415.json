{"quote":"There is no excuse good enough to ever be out of alignment with love. Youâ€™re going to get hurt, and you will feel pain. Yet your purpose is to keep loving, anyway. Keep moving forward with an open heart. Love is a Divine gift given to humanity. Wasting it is no longer an option. Love is what brings light to a dark place. Love is what transforms a dying world into a thriving planet.","author":"Alaric Hutchinson"}
