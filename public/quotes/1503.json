{"quote":"You must get to the root(s) of the things that are present in your life that are anti-you. Generally, a true mirroring is needed, but this mirroring cannot happen if you are still interacting with the things and people that affirm the lower self, that affirm the you that is out of alignment with wholeness.","author":"Victoria L.
