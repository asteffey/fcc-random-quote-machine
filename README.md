## Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-random-quote-machine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-random-quote-machine)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-random-quote-machine.  Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-random-quote-machine?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses React and Redux to create a random quote machine. 
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of SASS, Jest, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.

Each quotation is related to consciousness, a topic that I am personally fascinated by. I highly recommend David Chalmer's book on this subject,
[The Conscious Mind](http://consc.net/the-conscious-mind/), if you are also interested in exploring how matter such as ourselves can possess any phenomenal experiences at all.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine.
